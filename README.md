# Object-Oriented_Programming_Project

This program is a project management system for a small structural engineering firm called “Poised”. It is used to keep track of the many projects which the engineers work on.

The program has a class that will be used to create a project object, one for a person object and one for an invoice object.

The program allows the user to capture the details that will be used to create a new project object, change the due date of the project, change the total amount of the fee paid to date, update a contractor's contact details, generate an invoice for the client, mark the project as "finalised" with a completion date and lastly add all the info about the project to a text file called "Completed project".
